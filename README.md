# Hangman
A console version of Hangman written using Visual Studio.

One of the main goals of this project (other than having a friend to play games with) was to familiarize with standalone C# applications as well as using recursion in my code. I've found it somewhat difficult to find good places for recursion in other projects. The nature of verifying input from the user and having multiple letters in a single word setup a great enviroment to use recursive functions.
